# Skill Room Based Learning App – Concept Description

## Core Idea

The application is designed as a **virtual room-based learning space** where a user can explore, plan, and execute their learning journey in an interactive and structured way. The focus is on **exploration, choice, and personalization**, rather than forced or predefined learning paths.

---

## User Entry & Exploration

When a user logs in, they enter **their personal room**. This room acts as the main space from where they can explore different learning options and functionalities.

The room contains **multiple gates**, and each gate represents a learning stream or domain. The user is free to explore and choose the gates they are interested in.

The available gate options include multiple **rooms (modules)** designed specifically for an engineering student. These rooms represent different learning and preparation areas that an engineering student commonly needs.

Examples of available rooms include:

* AI / ML
* Data Scientist
* Cloud
* Project Manager
* Aptitude
* Data Structures & Algorithms
* Core Programming (C / C++ / Python / Java)
* Web Development
* Core Subjects (OS, DBMS, CN, COA)
* System Design (Basics)
* Placement Preparation
* Internship / Project Work

Users can select one or multiple rooms based on their academic and career requirements.

The user can choose one or multiple gates based on their interests.

---

## Gates & Learning Streams

Each selected gate opens into its own dedicated space. Inside every gate, the learning process is organized using **cupboards**.

There are **predefined gates available by default**, which already contain structured pathways. These pathways clearly define what topic should be done first and what should be done next, in a sequential manner.

Users also have the option to **generate their own gates** according to their personal learning requirements.

Inside every gate, cupboards represent **step-by-step learning components** within that specific stream. These cupboards are shown as **checkbox-based structures**, allowing the user to track what they are supposed to do in a clear and ordered way.

Each cupboard contains:

* Tasks related to that stream
* A step-wise structure
* Checkboxes to mark completion

This helps users understand what needs to be done next and how their learning is progressing.

---

## Personalized Folder Gate (AI-Based)

In addition to predefined cupboards, the app allows users to create a **personalized folder gate** using AI.

Through this feature, the user can define:

* How they want to learn
* The order in which they want to study
* Their personal preferences and pace

Based on this input, the AI generates a **custom folder gate** specifically tailored to the user’s learning style and goals.

---

## Certifications, Internships, and Projects Inside Rooms

Each room (module) contains its own **Certification, Internship, and Project folders**.

Inside every room, users can:

* Mark certifications related specifically to that room
* Track internships associated with that domain
* Track projects completed within that room

This helps users clearly understand **what they have gained from a particular room**, rather than maintaining everything in a single generic place.

All certifications, internships, and projects are therefore **room-specific**, ensuring clarity and proper categorization of achievements.

---

## Central Overview Section (Auto-Generated)

On the dashboard, there is a dedicated **overview section** whose name can be **customized by the user**.

This section provides a complete summary of the user’s profile, including:

* Total certifications completed
* Number of internships done
* Number of projects completed
* Work or experience-related progress

This overview section is **automatically generated and updated by the application**.

Whenever the user adds or updates information inside any room (certifications, internships, projects, or tasks), the system automatically reflects those changes in this section.

There is **no manual user interaction required** to update this overview. It acts as a consolidated view of the user’s overall progress and achievements across all rooms.

---

## Scheduling & Planning

The scheduling system supports **multiple modules at the same time**.

When a user selects more than one module (gate/room), each selected module **appears in the schedule by its module name** (for example: AI/ML, Cloud, Data Scientist).

The schedule does not directly list individual tasks first; instead, it shows **module-level entries**. Each module entry represents the corresponding room or folder selected by the user.

When the user opens a module from the schedule:

* The system displays **marked (completed) and unmarked (pending) tasks** inside that module
* Unmarked tasks are highlighted to guide what needs to be done next
* Progress inside the module determines movement to the next steps

This allows users to manage multiple learning modules in parallel while maintaining clarity on what is completed and what still needs attention.

The scheduling system works together with task completion tracking to keep learning structured and continuous.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of this application is to provide:

* A structured yet flexible learning environment
* Visual clarity through rooms, gates, and cupboards
* Personal control over learning paths
* Support for planning, tracking, and execution

The app is designed to feel intuitive, exploratory, and personalized, allowing users to learn in the way they prefer.

---

## User Interface Flow

### Login / Entry Screen

The first screen of the application is a **login interface**. Users can log in or sign up to access their personal learning space.

---

### User Dashboard (Personal Assistant View)

After logging in, the user is taken to their **dashboard**, which acts as a personal assistant interface.

This dashboard represents the user’s main room and provides an overview of:

* Selected gates (learning streams)
* Current tasks and schedules
* Upcoming deadlines

---

## Voice-Based Personal Assistant

The application works like a **personal assistant**, allowing users to interact using their **voice through a microphone**.

Users can speak natural commands such as:

* Submitting project deadlines
* Asking to schedule tasks
* Mentioning specific days or times

Example interaction:
A user can say that they need to submit a project before a certain day and ask the system to schedule it at a specific time.

---

## Smart Scheduling via Voice

Based on the user’s voice input:

* The system understands the task
* Extracts the deadline and preferred time
* Automatically updates the user’s schedule

Once processed, the **entire schedule is updated** and reflected on the dashboard.

---

## Dashboard Updates

After scheduling through voice input:

* Tasks appear in the daily plan
* Deadlines are clearly visible
* The user can track upcoming responsibilities

If a task is **not marked as completed on the assigned day**, the system automatically **reschedules it to the next available day** according to the existing schedule.

The system also considers the user’s **free time** while rescheduling tasks and sends **notifications** accordingly.

This ensures that unfinished tasks are not missed and the user remains aware of their responsibilities without manual re-planning.

The dashboard acts as a central place where users can view, manage, and stay notified about their tasks, schedules, and learning progress.
